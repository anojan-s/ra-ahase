                        <p class="pb-40 txt-primary">So it all started with an email to the Abhishek Banthia (creator and developer of Clocker) praising the app and asking if he has any plans to improve the  design and experience of the app. Luckily he had some plans for a design overhaul and some cool new features.</p>
                        <img class="pb-40"style="height:auto;" alt="Screenshots of clocker on both dark mode and light mode" width="668px" height="500px" src="./assets/images/clocker/clocker-dark-light-screenshot.png">
                        <p class="pb-40 txt-primary">The all new design needed a new good looking app icon to match. After couple of iterations, following is the final version of new app icon that we decided on.<br><br>We found few ways to illustrate the well known features as well new upcoming features on app icon. More than one “seconds” needle indicate the multi time zone feature and mini dots on background layer inidicate the upcoming calendar feature. This was a way for us to give a little bit of meaning and liviness to the app icon.</p>

                        <div class="divider mb-40"></div>
                        <p class="pb-40 txt-primary">As a designer who never worked on any macOS apps, this was a way for me to learn and execute macOS app design and interaction. The lack of community resources for macOS app design and interactions compared to iPhone and iPad is really surprising, so I decided to open source the designs as a way for me to give back to the community.</p>

                        <p class="pb-40 txt-primary">The all new design and features are not implemented yet but I suggest downloading the current version of Clocker on App Store. This will be a life saver when you work with remote teams on multiple timezones.</p>
