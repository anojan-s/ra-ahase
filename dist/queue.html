                        <p class="pb-40 txt-primary">Each awesome operations teams at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://different.com.au">:Different</a> has their own set of goals and most of them relies on getting to 100% (or to 0%) fastest. This is all about checking things off as soon and fast as possible. Currently, our tools doesn’t make this easy.<br><br>For an example, Maintenance Ops team at :Different uses Admin (our internal tool) to keep track of all the maintenance requests submitted by tenants. Requests are shown in a table, where the information is limited, and we can only see a small number of characters, and no media that relate to the request. That means for every request, we have to click to view, then click to go back or right click again to open in a new tab. Each day, all four Maintenance Ops team members do this for about 20-30 requests/day. In addition, they may also have to move to other tabs within Admin to find tenant or owner contact details so that they can have a conversation. In a day, these repetitive tasks take up at least 1 hour of every team member’s day.<br><br>A queue is the ideal system to handle this. Ultimately, what we build should make the Ops team feel powerful and that comes from speed and features.</p>
                        <!-- What is a queue? -->
                        <h3 class="pb-16">What is a queue?</h3>
                        <p class="pb-40 txt-primary">A queue has no end, and we should be able to rotate through it. The goal is always to have nothing left in the queue. We want to complete each thing one by one or skip and move to next.</p>
                        <!-- Co-designing with Ops -->
                        <h3 class="pb-16">Co-designing with Ops</h3>
                        <p class="pb-40 txt-primary">A queue will introduce a completely new interaction pattern, so we co-designed it with Ops so that we can make sure what we design is actually usable. To collect feedback, we tested each iterations with every Ops team member who’ll actually use it to get their work done and relying on their opinion when we struggle to make a final call. Their experience let us see where our ideas weren’t quite right, and iterate the design to improve the experience.</p>

                        <p class="pb-40 txt-primary">In a queue we want to complete each thing one by one, so every element in a queue should have:<br>• Full and complete information<br>• A clear set of actions that can be taken<br>• The ability to take the appropriate action and move to next or the ability to skip and move to next<br>With this we were able to define the core structures of a queue-based interaction.</p>

                        <p class="pb-40 txt-primary">With the way we designed and built the fundamentals of the queue, we were able to build queues for different teams in matter of time. Within just 4 months of introducing the pattern we already have three different queues currently used by Ops.<br><br>Queue has improved the Ops team’s ability to focus on the task in hand and build better process to improve the workflow and speed.  Seeing these messages from our awesome Ops team memebers make me proud of the impact my work had.</p>
